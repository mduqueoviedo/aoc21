My humble trying of Advent of Code 2021.

Merry Christmas and happy coding!!!

If you stumble here, let me give you a piece of advice :)

Some people don't want to share they are participating in AOC, precisely because other fellow devs say stuff of the sort of _"If you are having trouble with this or that AOC challenge, you are not a good developer!"_.

**Please.** Do us all a favour and don't be that person.

PS: If I were to listen to that, I can tell you I am not a good developer either. Join my club!

### Day 1

#### Star 1

Warming up! Set up input reader, not everyday you read and process a file...

#### Star 2

Not a specially elegant solution here, just make sure we don't read out of bounds.
Instead of reading line by line, extract "read 2 future readings" logic into a function and iterate with it.
